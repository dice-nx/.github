# DICE-NX

DICE-NX is a C compiler suite for Commodore Amiga computers and for Motorola 68000-based embedded systems.

It is a fork of the DICE product developed by Matt Dillon of Obvious Implementations Corp in the 1990s,
now relicensed under the BSD License.

DICE-NX aims to restart development of DICE with a focus on the modern retrocomputing scene, including
support for the latest AmigaOS 3.2 line.

DICE-NX is currently early in development. There is no packaged release yet, and building DICE-NX may be challenging!
